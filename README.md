# SpecialParents
This is a long-term project with an aim to benefit parents with children who have special needs. The idea is to provide a place whare tips and tricks are easily available, but also mutual support and for the low days and a platform for displaying pride on the high days.
The project was started on 25/09/2015 and uses a free Firebase account as the back-end solution, with AngularJS on the front-end.
One of the aims of this projects is to allow me to use the front-end/AngularJS skills that I have acquired and gain experience in a way that is useful to the world.
